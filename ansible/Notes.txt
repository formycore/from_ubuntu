----------------------------------
when ever we run the ansible-playbook
- it will run in a shell 
- after completion of the task the shell closes so that the work on the shell also closes
- if we want to run and continue the task(service) always prefer to run in the background
- using nohup & sysbols
-------------------------------------------------
- now the playbook run fine 
- i want to change the port number of the tomcat
- for that we need to copy the server.xml under /usr/local/latest/conf
- server.xml is under the root access 
- change the root access to the user access
- then copy that to the ansible server
